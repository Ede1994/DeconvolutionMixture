# Introduction
SpectrDeconv is a Open Source software that uses the shape of a measured spectrum to calculate its components by fitting the pure
(reference) spectrum of each component to the measured composite spectrum (mixture). It contains the possibility to import and fit measurement data of a gamma probe in a Marinelli bulb. The results are the fit graphically displayed as well as the calculated activity concentrations of each individual component.


# Installation
A short description of the required additional packages and how to create an executable under Windows or Ubuntu can be found in [Installation](/Installation).


# Help
You can find extra informations like mathematically basics in our publication related to this work [Paper](LINK!).

## Instruction
Command line (.py):
- bla bla

GUI (.py):
- the reference (pure) spectra are fixed -> you can change this in the source code, if necessary
- Use the "Import Data"-Button to import AND load specific data files (you can also write the PATH in the entry box by hand)
- Change the measuring time (default = 3600s)
- Press the "Spectrum Deconvolution"-Button to start the calculations

# Data
Check the [Data](/Data) folder for several measured data sets of different sources for tests.
