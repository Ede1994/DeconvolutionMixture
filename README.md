# Introduction
SpectrDeconv is a Open Source software that uses the shape of a measured spectrum to calculate its components by fitting the pure
(reference) spectrum of each component to the measured composite spectrum (mixture). It contains the possibility to import and fit measurement data of a gamma probe in a Marinelli bulb. The results are the fit graphically displayed as well as the calculated activity concentrations of each individual component.


# Installation
A short description of the required additional packages and how to create an executable under Windows or Ubuntu can be found in [Installation](/Installation).


# Help
You can find some background informations like mathematically basics in the folder [Background](/Background)!
For more instructions how to use the programms read help.txt.


# Data
Check the [Data](/Data) folder for several measured data sets of different sources for tests.
